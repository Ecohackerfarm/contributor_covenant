## Translating

We're always looking for new localizations of the Contributor Covenant and
are thankful to the volunteers who spend their time on translations.

If you are interested in doing a translation, please follow these steps:

* Fork the repository and make a branch for your translation.
* If it's a new language, add it to `config.toml`,
  with a localized name and language code/optional region (e.g. `pt` or `pt-br`).
* Create a markdown file with your translation in `version/1/4/code-of-conduct.LANGUAGECODE.md`.
* Open a pull request.
* We will put out a call to have one or more other native speakers review the translation.
* Collaborate until the translation is satisfactory.
* We will merge your translation!
* HTML and plain text versions are automatically generated from your markdown file.
* A link to your translation is automatically added to the translations page.

## Adding a Project to the List of Adopters

* Fork the repository.
* Add a new row to the [adopters.csv](static/adopters.csv) file,
  with the project name in the first column, and the project URL in the second column.
* Open a pull request.
